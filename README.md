# Copy as cURL for NSURLRequest (Objective-C and Swift)
This repository contains NSURLRequest category for Objetive-C and NSURLRequest
extension for Swift that generate apropriate cURL shell command from a
NSURLRequest object. This works the same as "Copy as cURL" command inside
Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

This is my first encounter with Swift language so swift version may not work
flawlessly.

# Usage
Just add appropriate source files to your project.
Objective-C source files are inside the directory objc/objc and Swift source
file is inside the folder swift/swift.
